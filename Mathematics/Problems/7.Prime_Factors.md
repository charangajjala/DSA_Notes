# Prime Factors of a Given Number

## Problem Statement

**We are given a number n. The task is to print all prime factors of n.**

Examples:

Input: n = 12  
Output: 2 2 3

Input: n = 315  
Output: 3 3 5 7

## Idea

- The idea is we can access the firt prime divisor of a number within sqrt(n)
- Also, the prime factors appear in powers like 2^2, 3^1, 5^2, etc.. So, we can extract the powers one by one staring from 2 ...

## Algorithm

- From i =2 to sqrt(n) :
  - while i divides n (then it is first prime divisor of n)
    - n = n/i
    - print(i) -- extracting powers of prime factors
  - If n >1:
    - print(n) - Edge case to handle if last prime factor has only power of 1, it wont be extracted in the above loop

## Code

```python
import math

def prime_factors(n):

    if n<=1:
        return   # no prime factors for 1

    for i in range(2, math.sqrt(n)+1):
        while n %i==0:
            print(n)
            n=n/i
        if n>1:
            print(n)

```
