# Prime Factors of a Given Number

## Problem Statement

**We are given a number n. The task is to print all prime factors of n.**

Examples:

Input: n = 12  
Output: 2 2 3

Input: n = 315  
Output: 3 3 5 7

## Idea

- The idea is we can access the firt prime divisor of a number within sqrt(n)
- Also, the prime factors appear in powers like 2^2, 3^1, 5^2, etc.. So, we can extract the powers one by one staring from 2 ...

## Algorithm

- From i =2 to sqrt(n) :
  - while i divides n (then it is first prime divisor of n)
    - n = n/i
    - print(i) -- extracting powers of prime factors
  - If n >1:
    - print(n) - Edge case to handle if last prime factor has only power of 1, it wont be extracted in the above loop

## Illustration

- First we identify the first prime divisor of n, which is 2 in the case of 84
- We keep dividing n by 2 until it is no longer divisible by 2
- Then, we again identify the first prime number of remaining n, which is 3 in the case of (3^2 \* 7)
- we keep dividing n by 3 until it is no longer divisible by 3
- If n >1, we print n as it is the last prime factor.
  - The edge case occurs when last prinme factor is power of 1, since the sqrt(n) < n, hence the loop will not extract it.
  - If the last prime factor is powers of >1, then loop continues and make the final "n" zero.

## Code

```python
import math

def prime_factors(n):

    if n<=1:
        return   # no prime factors for 1

    for i in range(2, math.sqrt(n)+1):
        while n %i==0:
            print(n)
            n=n/i
    if n>1:
      print(n)

```
