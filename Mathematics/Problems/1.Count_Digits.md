## Problem Statement

**We are given an n-digit number. The task is to find the number of digits in the number, provided that, n>0.**  
Examples:

Input: 256  
Output: 3

Input: 75  
Output: 2

Input: 5  
Output: 1

## Algorithm

- Everytime we divide the number by 10, we remove the last digit of the number.
- We keep dividing the number by 10 until the number becomes 0 and keep track of the count of the number of times we divided the number by 10.

## Code

```python
'''
Time: Theta(d), d:no.of digits
'''
def count_digits(n):
    count = 0
    while(n!=0):
        n = n//10
        count+=1
    return count

```
