## Problem Statement

**We are given a number. The task is to find the factorial of the number. The factorial (n!) of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number.
n>=0**

Examples:  
Input: 4
Output: 4*3*2\*1 = 24

Input: 6
Output: 6*5*4*3*2\*1 = 720

Input: 0
Output: 1

Input: 1
Output: 1

## Iterative Solution

- we simply calculate the product using a for loop

### Code

```python
'''
Time: Theta(n)
Space: Theta(1)
'''
def factorial(n):
    res = 1
    for i in range(2,n+1):
        res = res*i
    return res

```

## Recursive Solution

- The factorial is nothing but n! = n\*(n-1)!
- Apply this in the form of recursion

### Code

```python
'''
Time: Theta(n)
Space: Theta(n)
'''
def factorial(n):
    if n==0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n-1)
```

**Iterative solution is better** in in terms of space.
