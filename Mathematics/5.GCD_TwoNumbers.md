## Problem Statement

**We are given two numbers. The task is to find the GCD / HCF of the numbers.**

Examples:
Input: a = 20, b = 28

Output: 4

Explanation: The factors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20.

The factors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.

Among these factors, 1, 2, and 4 are the common factors of both 20 and 28. The greatest among the common factors is 4.

## Algorithm

- There is **euclidian algorithm** to find the GCD of two numbers.
- The algorithm is as follows:
  - If a = 0, then GCD(a,b) = b
  - If b = 0, then GCD(a,b) = a
  - If a = b, then GCD(a,b) = a
  - If a > b, then GCD(a,b) = GCD(a-b,b)
  - If a < b, then GCD(a,b) = GCD(a,b-a)
- It can further be optimized to avoid the subtraction operation by using the modulo operator.
- The optimized algorithm is as follows:
  - If a = 0, then GCD(a,b) = b
  - If b = 0, then GCD(a,b) = a
  - If a = b, then GCD(a,b) = a
  - If a > b, then GCD(a,b) = GCD(a%b,b)
  - If a < b, then GCD(a,b) = GCD(a,b%a)

## Code

```python
'''
Time: O(log(min(a,b))), Space: O(1)
'''

def gcd(a,b):

    if b == 0:
        return a

    return gcd(b,a%b)

```

## LCM of two numbers

- Lcm of two numbers can be calculated using the formula:
  - LCM(a,b) = (a\*b)/GCD(a,b)
