## Asymptotic Analysis

- It is way of analyzing the performance of an algorithm in terms of input size by mapping time/spaces complexity of an algorithm to a function of input size (n)
- It doesnt depend on the machine or the programming language used.
- No need of implementing the code instead we can analyze the algorithm.
- We only consider the cases where n is very large (n->infinity)
- We can avoid lower order terms and constant factors.

## Order of Growth

- It is the rate at which the running time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input increases.
- A function f(n) has a higher order of growth than g(n) if f(n) grows faster than g(n) as n becomes large that is when:
