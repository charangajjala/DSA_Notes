## Problem Statement
**Given an array A[ ] of positive integers of size N, where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are M students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets among M students such that** :
1. Each student gets exactly one packet.
2. The difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and minimum number of chocolates given to a student is minimum.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 8, M = 5  
A = {3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12}  
Output: 6  
Explanation: The minimum difference between 
maximum chocolates and minimum chocolates 
is 9 - 3 = 6 by choosing following M packets :
{3, 4, 9, 7, 9}.

## Algorithm
- Sort the given array 
- Then the problem reduces to finding the difference between minium and maximum in contiguous subarray of size M.
- Apply sliding window approach

## Code 
```python
   '''
   Time : O(NlogN)
   Space: O(N) (doubt)
   '''
   def findMinDiff(self, arr,N,M):

        arr.sort()
        res = float('inf')
        for i in range(0,N):
            f_idx = i
            l_idx = i+M-1
            
            if l_idx >= N:
                break
            diff = arr[l_idx]-arr[f_idx]
            res = min(res,diff)
            
        return res
