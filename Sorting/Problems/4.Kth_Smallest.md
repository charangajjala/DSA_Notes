## Problem Statement
Given an array and a number k where k is smaller than the size of the array, we need to find the k'th smallest element in the given array. It is given that all array elements are distinct.

Examples:  

Input: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15}, k = 3    
Output: 7 

Input: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15}, k = 4  
Output: 10 

## Algorithm
- Use quick sort idea of partioning
- Use lomuto partiotion. The pivot index after partioning gives the (p+1)th smallest element.
- Until your k=p+1 apply partioning on the left or right half arrays.

## Code 
```python
   def kthSmallest(arr, n, k):

    l, r = 0, n-1
    while l <= r:
        p = lamuto_partition(arr, l, r)
        if p == k-1:
            return arr[p]
        elif p > k-1:
            r = p-1
        else:
            l = p+1
    return -1

```
