## Problem Statement
Write a function `nonRep()` that takes a string as input and returns the index of the leftmost non-repeating character in the string. If there are no non-repeating characters, the function should return -1.

Example:
**Input:** "geeksforgeeks" <br>
**Output:** 5 <br>
**Explanation:** The leftmost non-repeating character is 'f' and its index is 5.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize an integer array `fI` of size 256, to store the first occurrence of each character of the string. Initialize all elements of the array to -1.
2. Traverse the string from left to right and for each character calculate the following:
     - If its first occurrence has not been found yet, store its index in the array `fI`.
     - If its first occurrence has already been found, update the corresponding element of the array as -2.
3. Traverse the `fI` array and find the index of the first element which is not -1 or -2, and return its value.

## Python Code
```python

'''
Time: O(N+CHAR)
Space: O(CHARA)
'''
def nonRep(str):
    CHAR = 256
    fI = [-1] * CHAR

    for i in range(len(str)):
        if fI[ord(str[i])] == -1:
            fI[ord(str[i])] = i
        else:
            fI[ord(str[i])] = -2

    res = float("inf")
    for i in range(CHAR):
        if fI[i] >= 0:
            res = min(res, fI[i])

    return res if res != float("inf") else -1

str = "geeksforgeeks"
print("Index of leftmost non-repeating element:")
print(nonRep(str))
