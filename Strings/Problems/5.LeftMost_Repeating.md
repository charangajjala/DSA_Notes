## Problem Statement 
Find the index of the leftmost character which repeats in the string 
1. Input: "hello"
   Output: 2
   Explanation: The leftmost repeating character in the string "hello" is "l", which occurs at index 2.

2. Input: "world"
   Output: -1
   Explanation: There are no repeating characters in the string "world", so the function should return -1.

## Algorithm 
1. Initialize a list "visited" of size CHAR (256 in this case) and all values set to False. This list is used to keep track of visited characters.
2. Initialize a variable "res" to -1. This variable is used to keep track of the index of the leftmost non-repeating character.
3. Traverse the string from the right to the left using a for loop.
4. For each character in the string, get its corresponding ASCII value using the "ord" function and store it in a variable "char".
5. Check if the character at this index has already been visited by checking if visited[char] is True. If it is True, set res to the current index i.
6. If visited[char] is False, update visited[char] to True.
7. Once the loop is complete, return the value of res. This will be the index of the leftmost non-repeating character if one exists, else it will be -1.

## Code 
```python
'''
Time: O(N)
Space: O(CHAR)
'''
CHAR = 256

def leftMost(string):
    visited = [False] * CHAR
    res = -1
    for i in range(len(string) - 1, -1, -1):
        char = ord(string[i])
        if visited[char]:
            res = i
        else:
            visited[char] = True
    return res

```
