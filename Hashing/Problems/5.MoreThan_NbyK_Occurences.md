# More Than N/K Occurences 

# Problem Statement 
Print all the elements in the arrays with count >n/k where n is size of the array, k is given 

## Approch1
- Just create frequqncy map and print elements accordingly
- Time: O(N) Space: O(N) 

## Approch2 
- If K is very small and N is very large, then we can try to make it more efficient

### Algorithm 
Idea: Similar to Moores voting alogirthm 
- Initialize an empty hash map m.
- Iterate over the elements of the input array arr:
  - a. If the current element is already in m, increment its count by 1.
  - b. Otherwise, if the size of m is less than k-1, add the current element to m with a count of 1.
  - c. Otherwise, decrement the count associated with each element in m, and remove any element whose count becomes 0.
- Iterate over the keys of m:
  - a. For each key, count the number of occurrences of the key in arr.
  - b. If the count is greater than n/k, print the key.
- The idea behind this algorithm is to use a hash map to keep track of the counts of elements in the input array. 
- The algorithm maintains the invariant that the hash map m contains **at most k-1 distinct elements** that have non-zero counts.
-  When the size of m reaches k-1, the algorithm starts removing elements from m whose counts have become zero, and hence ensures that m always contains at most k-1 distinct elements with non-zero counts.

### Code 
```python

Time: O(NK)
Space: O(K)

    def print_n_by_k(arr, n, k):
        m = {}
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] in m:
                count = m[arr[i]]
                m[arr[i]] = count + 1
            elif len(m) < k - 1:
                m[arr[i]] = 1
            else:
                for x in m:
                    c = m[x]
                    m[x] = c - 1
                    if m[x] == 0:
                        del m[x]
        for x in m:
            count = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if x == arr[i]:
                    count += 1
            if count > n / k:
                print(x, end=' ')
