## Problem Statement 
**Given an array of positive integers. Find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.**
 
Example 1:

Input:
N = 7
a[] = {2,6,1,9,4,5,3}

Output:
6

Explanation:
The consecutive numbers here
are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. These 6 
numbers form the longest consecutive
subsquence.

## Intuition 
- Consider the naive approach where we sort the array and count the consecutives upto each break and find max of these counts.
- We can do the same thing using hash set without sorting the array

## Algorithm 
- Create set of the array
- For each number in the set
   - If num-1 doesnt exist in the set, then it is the starting of a consecutive sequence. Keep counting by  checking if num+1 exists in the set
   - If num-1 exists, then simply ignore it since it is not the start of a sequence
 - Compute the max of the counts 

## Code 
```python
  '''
  Time: O(N)
  Space: O(N)
  '''
  def findLongestConseqSubseq(self,arr, N):
        #code here
        hold = set(arr)
        res=0
        
        for num in hold:
            count = 0
            if num-1 not in hold:
                count+=1
                while num+1 in hold:
                    count+=1
                    num+=1
                res=max(res,count)
            
        return res
```
