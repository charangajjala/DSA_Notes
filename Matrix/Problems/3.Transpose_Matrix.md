## Problem Statement
Transpose the given square matrix in place without extra space 

## Algorithm
- Swap corresponding upper diagonal elements with lower diagonal elements
- For each row, process the upper diagonal elements and swap [i][j] with [j][i]

## Code 
```python

def transpose(mat,n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1,n):
            mat[i][j],mat[j][i] = mat[j][i],mat[i][j]

```
