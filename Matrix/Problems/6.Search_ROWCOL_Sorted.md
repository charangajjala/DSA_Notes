## Problem Statement 
**Given an n x n matrix and a number x, find the position of x in the matrix if it is present in it. Otherwise, print "Not Found". In the given matrix, every row and column is sorted in increasing order. The designed algorithm should have linear time complexity.**

Example: 
Input: mat[4][4] =            { {10, 20, 30, 40},  
                               15, 25, 35, 45},  
                               {27, 29, 37, 48},  
                             {32, 33, 39, 50}}    
           x = 29  
Output: Found at (2, 1)  
Explanation: Element at (2,1) is 29  

## Intuition
- The simple idea is to remove a row or column in each comparison until an element is found. Start searching from the top-right corner of the matrix. There are three possible cases. 
- The given number is greater than the current number: 
    - This will ensure that all the elements in the current row are smaller than the given number as the pointer is already at the right-most elements and the row is sorted.
- The given number is smaller than the current number: 
    - This will ensure that all the elements in the current column are greater than the given number.
- The given number is equal to the current number: This will end the search.

## Algorithm 
- start at top right corner
- If key < curr : move left
- If key > curr : move down
- Else found key 

## Code 
```python
   '''
   Time: O(N+M)
   Space: 1
   '''
   def search(self,mat, n, m, x): 
    	
    	i,j=0,m-1  # top right corner
    	
    	while i<n and j>=0:
    	    
    	    if x < mat[i][j]:  # move left
    	        j-=1
    	        
    	    elif x>mat[i][j]:  # move down
    	        i+=1
    	        
    	    else:
    	        return True   # found at i,j
    	   
    	return False
